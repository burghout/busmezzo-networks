# network
Contains Busmezzo networks

- Master branch contains stable networks that run with current versions of BusMezzo
- Testing branch contains new networks, networks that are being debugged, and networks that are being updated

# How to add a network
- Fork off of testing to make your own sandbox and push back to testing when you are happy for others to test the network (and create a pull request)
- In each network folder add a README.md doc describing the network, which version/branch of BusMezzo it was used with, and links to article(s) in which it was used
