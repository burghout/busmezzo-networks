# Busmezzo networks
Contains Busmezzo networks

- Master branch contains stable networks that run with current versions of Mezzo and BusMezzo
- Testing branch contains new networks, networks that are being debugged, and networks that are being updated
- All changes to master should be pushed immediately to testing so all stable networks are there as well
- Fork off of testing to make your own sandbox and push back to testing when you are happy for others to test the network (and create a pull request)
- Mezzo folder contains Mezzo networks, and BusMezzo folder contains BusMezzo networks
- In each network folder add a README.md doc describing the network in a few words
