# Busmezzo networks

- Master branch contains stable networks that run with current versions of BusMezzo
- Testing branch contains new networks, networks that are being debugged, and networks that are being updated

# How to add a network
- If you simply want to upload a network, checkout this repository, add a folder for your network, put in the files and commit. 
- If you want to debug a network, make changes, use "testing". If you make substantial changes, make your own branch and create a pull request when you are happy for others to test the network (and create a pull request)
- In each network folder add a README.md doc describing the network, which version/branch of BusMezzo it was used with, and links to article(s) in which it was used
